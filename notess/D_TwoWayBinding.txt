 What is 2-way binding?
It means:
✅ UI (input box) updates the state (data)
✅ State (data) updates the UI (input box)

So, changes in either side will reflect on the other.

1. User types in input box ➡️ handleChange runs ➡️ name state updates

2. State updates ➡️ value={name} makes input box show latest value

3. Below text also shows the updated name from state

This back-and-forth connection is called 2-way binding
