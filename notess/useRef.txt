// states wanted, but no repaint req => useRef
const noOfUpdates = useRef(0) 
0 is initial value here
// b/w rendreing cycles, its value will update, but no repaint is done
// noOfUpdates is just a reference, therefore, noofupdates.current OR noofupdates.current.value is done to get value
// set noofupdates
    noOfUpdates.current += 1;


while typing in input, useState is repainting the cycle for evry alphabet we type, to avoid such many repaints, we can use useRef

ref attribute

now no need for state change, and no need for handler methods that we created, no need for two way binding

performance enhanced
